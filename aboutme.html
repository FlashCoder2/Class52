    My name is Naveel Naveed. I was born in Karachi Pakistan on December 5, 2008. I am currently 11 years old
and live in Toronto, Canada. I attend virtual school due to the COVID-19 pandemic but before that I was
attending David Lewis P.S. I like Math and Computer things. This ultimately makes me like coding aswell.
Therefore I am currently taking, and will continue take for 2 years, coding classes at WhiteHat Jr. I have
completed game creation and now have passed on to HTML and CSS coding. 

 <br> The classes that I am attending at WhiteHat Jr are very fun and engaging.I like children get taught high
standard coding even though we are not really that old. It is fun because there are no limitations, like we
can make any type of game, app, or website. It even teaches us Space Tech at one point. All in all it is an
amazing set of classes. To top it all of I have a astounding teacher named Priyansha Garg.

<br> My teacher's name is Priyansha Garg. She is very nice and helpful. She helps me with my projects and 
encourages me to keep trying. She is always there at classes, I don't think there has been one day when she
hasn't come to class and I had to have a supply teacher. She always makes my day better and make me more 
eager to attend coding classes.
